# 🧬 Natural Language Processing (NLP) 

## 📌 What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. It enables machines to understand, interpret, generate, and respond to human language in a valuable way.

NLP powers applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, translation, voice assistants, and more.


## 🎉 How is NLP Fun?

- You can build chatbots like Alexa or Siri.
- Detect emotions in social media posts.
- Automatically summarize books or articles.
- Translate text between languages.
- Create AI that talks and understands like humans!

It combines **coding**, **creativity**, and **real-world impact**—a perfect mix of tech and language!


## 🎯 Prerequisites

Before diving into NLP, it's helpful to have:

- ✅ Basic Python programming knowledge
- ✅ Understanding of data types, loops, and functions
- ✅ Familiarity with basic math (algebra, probability)
- ✅ Interest in language, grammar, and communication

### Let's get Started


## 🔧 Setup & Installation

To get started with NLP using **NLTK**, follow these steps:

### 1. Install NLTK
You can install NLTK using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
```

### 2. Download NLTK Resources
After installation, open a Python shell or script and run:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
```

🛑 Though since the above takes a lot of space and time, we can do the following instead.
For selective downloads:

```python
nltk.download('punkt')          # Tokenizers
nltk.download('stopwords')      # Common stop words
nltk.download('wordnet')        # WordNet Lemmatizer
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')  # For sentiment analysis

```
